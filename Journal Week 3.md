## Resonances

 "A heart-centered archaeology is one that allows us to connect our whole selves to our practice..." (Baxter, 2020)

## Response to the Prompts
I have been struggling to keep up with the course and thus while I have picked out a collection of memorial photos for the alternative assignment, I have only looked at them briefly and have failed to come anywhere close to fully cataloging, mapping and modelling them. What I do know is that the memorials I have are a collection of what seem to be family lots which is rather interesting. On the website, there were even more memorials for people with these shared last names which does lead me to believe that the graveyard is used primarily for family burials.
