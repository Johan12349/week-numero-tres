# what I was trying to do
I tried to keep up with the course and keep myself from falling behind.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

I mean, my falling behind doesn't really correlate with much, the best "research" I can compare it to is that my previous online semesters had mostly larger projects with staggered due dates, allowing for me to focus on one course assignment at a time, prioritizing assignments with sooner due dates; thus with all of my courses this semester opting to utilize smaller weekly assessments, as well as my finally having a job while doing school, I have found it more difficult to keep up with everything compared to previous years. I will also say it does not help that my job now has me working ~30 hours a week compared to when I was working during second semester last year only 15-20 hours a week. I need the money though so I unless things get really bad school wise I don't think I'll be asking to cut back my hours. I'll see how things look after reading week I guess.

## what I did

+ Listened to podcast
	+ gained knowledge of what to do for the week and general knowledge about digital archaeology
+ read the readings
	+ basic understanding of reading topics gained
+ Picked about 8 or so photos of memorials to categorize
	+ tried to start the process



## challenges 
The biggest challenge has been trying to keep up with the work while maintaining progress in my other courses as well as working so I can pay for rent, food and school. I have been struggling to put this course ahead of the others as this course only needs things due on Sundays and thus I put it off to do other things and struggle to catch up for the week come Sunday.
## thoughts on where to go next

Will try to keep up with what needs to be done and minimize how far behind I am so that I am either relatively caught up come reading week or at least be able to catch up fairly easily over the reading week. My work schedule is not looking very kind for the upcoming weeks plus I am planning to head home for Thanksgiving so luckily next week is a sort of catch up week, which I will do my best to take full advantage of.
